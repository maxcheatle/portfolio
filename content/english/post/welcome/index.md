## Welcome

> Hey, my name is Max. I'm a graduate of London Business School (MSc) and the London School of Economics (BSc), and have experience working in Big Tech, and a tech-startup.

I created this as a portfolio of my data analysis skills. Most of the work here is using R, as I'm super interested in statistical programming - you can explore the ***categories*** and ***tags*** sections if you're looking for something in particular, or use my [search](www.maxcheatle.com/search) function.
